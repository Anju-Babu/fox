  <h2>What do foxes consume in the wild?</h2>
  <p>Foxes are opportunistic omnivores, allowing them to thrive in a variety of environments. Rabbits and field voles are popular prey, but a fox's diet can also include worms and insects, as well as deer fawns and fruit. Urban foxes will still seek live prey, but they will also eat any food that has been discarded by humans.<br>

  <h2>What is the habitat of foxes?</h2>
  <p>Foxes can be found all over the United Kingdom and can thrive in a variety of environments. The amount of food available determines the number of foxes in a given location. A fox's territory can be as small as 25 hectares in metropolitan settings, where food is generally plentiful. A territory in upland Scotland, where food is scarcer, may be as vast as 4,000 hectares.
